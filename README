Xenon Retroblast
================

Xenon Retroblast is a steampunk themed vertical shooter inspired by
the classic (Xenon 2:
Megablast)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_2_Megablast].

It's designed to be extensible (custom weapons, levels, enemies etc.)
and is themed to look like an old charlie chaplin era movie.

It is written in Python and uses the PyGame SDL wrapper.
